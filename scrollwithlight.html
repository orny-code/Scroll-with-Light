    <h1>Scroll With Light Effect</h1>
    <p>
      This effect is done using only HTML and CSS.
      The spotlight reveals text as you scroll down the page.

      Look carefully – outside the circle everything is dark,
      but inside the light circle the text becomes visible.

    <p>AI Overview
In HTML, a paragraph is represented by the p element, which serves to structure and display blocks of text on a webpage. Browsers automatically add a margin before and after p elements, creating visual separation between paragraphs. For example, to create two distinct paragraphs in HTML, each block of text would be enclosed within its own opening p and closing /p tags. Extra spaces or line breaks within the HTML code of a paragraph are ignored by the browser, which renders the text as a continuous block unless explicitly broken by elements like br.</p>
<p>CSS is used to style these HTML paragraphs, allowing for control over their visual presentation. Properties such as font-family, font-size, color, text-align, line-height, margin, and padding can be applied to <p> elements to customize their appearance. For instance, to change the font color of all paragraphs to blue and add a 10-pixel padding, the following CSS could be used:
Code

p {
  color: blue;
  padding: 10px;
}
This demonstrates how HTML provides the structural foundation for content, while CSS enhances its visual styling and layout.</p>
